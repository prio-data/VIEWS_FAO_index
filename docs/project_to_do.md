# Project To Do

## Operational priorities 
*The following items are of the highest priority to insure correct organization of all existing and future tasks*

1. **Update and migrate codebook to become a markdown file, which will be added to this repository.** This is to supplement technical documents, and easily answer questions when examing the repository. Currently, a codebook exists in both LaTex and pdf format.

2. **Update google cloud storage data with new functions.** New functions have been developed, creating pre-processed data transformations that need to be added.

3. **Explore hosting solutions for visualisations (plots) and premade tables.** One potential option is to expand the google cloud storage. Other options need to be explored. Untill then, all visualisations and premade tables are able to be generated within code available in this repository.

4. **Clarify ingestion of most recent population data.** 

5. **Clarify table function and ensure all existing code is migrated to this standard repo.** This ensures all neccessary material is within one place.

## Organizational Priorites 

1. Glossary - updating and finalizing 
2. Use ADR and READ.ME file templates from VIEWS_pipeline and apply to this repo. Would be used to help fill in technical reports and keep track of decision making. 


## Best practices 

1. Consistently plot and visualize data to evalute 
2. Document all bugs then develop test functions to capture and alert to potential errors (e.g. when doing mathimatical calculations).
